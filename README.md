# Python playground

So I decided to finally seat down and learn python the right way

This is my playground to all my python code

### Guess game

The [guess game](/guess-game) it's a simple control flow example. You try to guess a `number` between 0 and 10.

### Palindrome

The [palindrome](/palindrome) test takes a `string` and checks if it's equals to the reverse of itself, ignoring cases and special characters.

### Grocery shopping

The [grocery shopping](/grocery-shopping) it's a example on how to read and write python objects on files using pickle.

### File operations

The [file operations](/file-operations) encrypts a text using the caesar cipher(for now) and stores in a file.

### Object serializer

The [object serializer](/object-serializer) takes an object as a argument and serializes into `json`.
