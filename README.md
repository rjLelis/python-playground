# Python playground

So I decided to finally seat down and learn python the right way

This is my playground to all my python code

### Guess game
The [guess game](/guess-game) it's a simple control flow example. You try to guess a `number` between 0 and 10.

### Palindrome
The [palindrome](/palindrome) test takes a `string` and checks if it's equals to the reverse of itself, ignoring cases and special characters.

### Grocery shopping
The [grocery shopping](/grocery-shopping) it's a example on how to read and write python objects on files using pickle.

### Password storage [WIP]
The [password storage](/password-storage) encrypts a password using the caesar cipher(for now) and stores in a file.
