# File operations

A lab to some file operations

* `file-encrypt` -> CLI that encrypts a file using the caesar cipher

* `file_utils.py` -> Some helping functions such as write/read files

#### Obs: unidecode must be installed in order to `file-encrypt.py` to work, install it from the `requirements.txt`
